I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>, UK, with research interests in Data Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Recommender Systems.

Postdoctoral Research Associate
======
Leading a project with a start-up to build data pipelines to enable content recommendation based 
on user behaviour with a mobile app. The app is a work-based e-learning tool used by employees 
to learn skills relevant to their roles within the company.

PhD
======

The theme of my PhD is investigating how user interactions (such as clicks, keystrokes, and
touch gestures) can be modelled to garner an understanding of the user's experience with online and broadcast media.
Currently, I'm exploring how large logs of interaction data, collected from live production
experiences, can be used to discover predictive features of engagement and abandonment. 

The application of my work is to: 

1. Have a positive impact on the user's experience while consuming BBC content; 
2. Inform content creators through data-driven recommendations; 
3. Provide the BBC with an in-depth picture of the user's experience through understandable metrics.

As part of my PhD, I'm lucky enough to be embedded into a development team in BBC R&D, where I 
work closely to shape how and what data is collected from live systems. 

I'm supervised by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/people/andy-brown">Dr Andy Brown</a> (BBC R&D), <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/caroline.jay.html">Dr Caroline Jay</a> (University of Manchester), and <a href="http://nactem.ac.uk/profile.php?member=jkeane">Professor John Keane</a> (University of Manchester).

Pre-PhD
=======

Before starting my PhD, I achieved a first-class MComp (Hons) degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/">Newcastle University</a> specialising in Big Data & Cloud Computing (2017).  

While at Newcastle, I was a Research Assistant (Summer 2017) in the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/groups/scalable/#about">Scalable Computing Group</a> on <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/projects/asoftwareinfrastructureforpromotingefficiententomologicalmonitoringofde.html">efficient entomological monitoring of dengue fever</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/people/profile/paolomissier.html#background">Dr Paolo Missier</a>, where I worked on evaluating a user ranking algorithm that was developed as part of my master's and bachelor's thesis. The position formed the continuation of an academic collaboration between Newcastle University and <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/english/">PUC-RIO</a>.
